Accessing clients in MATLAB
===========================

Although there is no MATLAB client for Radiens, the Python client may be accessed via MATLAB using some built-in functionality.

1. First download and install Python if not already installed, but check that you have (or are installing) the correct Python version for your version of MATLAB `here <https://www.mathworks.com/content/dam/mathworks/mathworks-dot-com/support/sysreq/files/python-compatibility.pdf>`_. For trouble shooting see `these docs <https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/install-supported-python-implementation.html>`_.

2. Next you need to tell matlab where your python executable is (if you are using an environment direct ``pypath`` to that binary).  The following lines must be run once upon every matlab launch. It's recommended that you run these lines outside of your main script, especially if you are running an acquisition loop.

.. literalinclude:: ../tutorials/set_pypath.m
    :language: matlab


3. The following command only needs to be run once per unique ``pypath``. That is, you'll only have to install radiens again if you change the python executable matlab uses.

.. literalinclude:: ../tutorials/install_radiens.m
    :language: matlab

4. Once the above has executed successfully, you can access the clients. The following are the same use cases we saw :ref:`previously <Python examples>`, but this time in MATLAB.

Note that converting from Python to MATLAB types adds a bit of latency, and the true loop duration may be
