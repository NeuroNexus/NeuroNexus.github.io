First, start the ALLEGO app. Then you can access it in python like this

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from radiens import AllegoClient

    >>> client = AllegoClient()
    >>> stat = client.get_status()
    >>> stat.sample_freq
    20000.0
    

For VIDERE, first start the app. Access the client in python like this 

.. code-block:: python

    from radiens import VidereClient

    client = VidereClient()
