Introduction
============

Radiens supports Python 3.7 and newer. 

Installation
------------

Install the most recent Radiens version using pip:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install radiens


Basic Usage
-----------
Radiens currently provides two clients ``AllegoClient`` and ``VidereClient`` that can be used to interact with their respective servers `ALLEGO` and `VIDERE`. 

First, start the ALLEGO app. Then you can access it in python like this

.. code-block:: python

    from radiens import AllegoClient

    client = AllegoClient()
    cfg = client.get_config()

It is best practice to run ``client.get_config()`` everytime you start a session with ALLEGO or change the sampling rate. 
This is because it initializes the sampling rate on the client. This is especially important if you are going to stream live signals (using ``client.get_signals()``).

.. code-block:: python

    >>> client = AllegoClient()
    >>> client.samp_freq
    None
    >>> client.get_config()
    >>> client.samp_freq
    20000.0

For VIDERE, first start the app. Access the client in python like this

.. code-block:: python

    from radiens import VidereClient

    client = VidereClient()
